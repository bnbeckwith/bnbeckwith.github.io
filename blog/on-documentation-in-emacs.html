<h2 id="orgheadline1">Built-in Documentation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
Emacs boasts built-in documentation.  What does it mean to be
built-in?  In this case, the documentation is tightly coupled with
the code at a function granularity.  This means that every time a
function changes, the opportunity to update documentation arises.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Ink is better than the best memory.   &#x2013; Chinese proverb 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This method facilitates up-to-date documentation for function
specifics.  But there are other types of documentation necessary.
Categories of functionality, frequently used sets, or even
user-defined are all ways to look at classes of commands.
</p>

<p>
How does a user learn what is available?  For me, it is exploration.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2">Starting a path</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
Another engineer gave the following challenge: How to open a file
into a new window (splitting) with <code class="code">C-x C-f</code>.
</p>

<p>
Immediately, I knew that I would have to check the full feature set
of <code class="verbatim">find-file</code> (usually bound to <code class="code">C-x C-f</code>).  Would there be an
extra argument supplied by <code class="code">C-u</code>? Or maybe a function wrapper was in
order?  I was also excited about the possibility of sharing how
functions can be <i>advised</i> to perform additional tasks.  Or maybe
this is something that would fit into function hooks.
</p>

<p>
What I knew for sure is that the path started with <code class="code">C-x C-f</code>.  A
quick trip to <code class="code">C-h k</code> and I read the right documentation
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3">Taking a stroll</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
Reading the documentation yielded nothing readily availble built
into <code class="verbatim">find-file</code>.
</p>

<p>
What I do next is quickly scan the help text for any hyperlinks to
additional documentation or files.  I skipped Tramp as that wasn't
what I wanted.  I also skipped the links to <code class="verbatim">file-file-wildcards</code>
and <code class="verbatim">find-file-literally</code> since they also seemed to be of little
use.
</p>

<p>
The only other link is to <code class="verbatim">files.el</code>.  Naturally, I took a
peek. Open source always prides itself on the ability to share the
implementation details.
</p>

<p>
Initially, I was looking to see how hard it would be to wrap
find-files to split the window. I was then going to choose between
writing a wrapper to rebind to <code class="code">C-x C-f</code> or advising <code class="verbatim">find-files</code>.
</p>

<p>
Neither solution was necessary. Following <code class="verbatim">find-files</code> only a
half-page down was <code class="verbatim">find-file-other-window</code>.  
</p>

<p>
Reading the documentation string indicated that this was <i>exactly</i>
the function I needed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline4">Finding Bindings</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
With my function in hand, all I had to do now was find any default
bindings.  If none existed, then I would have some decisions to
make.
</p>

<p>
Again using the built-in documentation via <code class="code">C-h C-f</code>, I found that
it was in fact already bound.  <code class="code">C-x 4 C-f</code> or <code class="code">C-x 4 f</code> will open a
file in the other window splitting first if necessary.
</p>

<p>
In this case, the dynamic built-in documentation presented me with
existing options.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline5">Alternate paths</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
I'm always interested if there is more on the topic.  Once I had my
function name, the know-it-all Google provided me with additional
commentary on the function.
</p>

<p>
In the Emacs manual, section 18.2 talks of Visiting Files.  Here is
where I found my category of alike functions.  Now I know how to
quickly open a file read-only, in a different window, closing a
buffer first or even in a separate frame.
</p>

<p>
I also know it is in my included Emacs manual through <code class="verbatim">info</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline6">Making a Map</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
This is positive story with a desired outcome. I wonder, though, how
many new users would be able to do the same. I think they would find
it difficult.
</p>

<p>
My next thoughts are how to enable them to find similar paths for
their issues.  What skills do they need?  What trailheads can I give
them? How can I help them from feeling lost? 
</p>

<p>
What paths will they take?
