      <article id="content"><section id="root"><p>Recently, I found myself needing a solution for tracking issues and
comments in source code during a review. Org mode makes this task much
better and easier overall. 
</p><p>First, let me explain how it is better. During a review, most comments
focus on issues on particular line numbers.  This means that the code
needs must have line numbers displayed. That way, everyone can be
clear about the particular line for a given issue.  In emacs, this is
easily done with 
<verbatim>linum-mode</verbatim>. This completes the first
<!-- 
 -->requirements of being able to view the code. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><section class="hsec2"><h2>Setup</h2><p>Now, a note-taker in the meeting faces the issue of tracking all of
the comments and issues given by the reviewers.  This can be a tedious
task.  First, get the line with the issue, capture the issue and
assign a priority.  All of this goes into a list for the author to
consider when fixing the codebase.
</p><p>Org-mode makes this task much easier with its ability to capture
issues quickly and with context.  With a keystroke, a scribe can more
easily fill in the details given and assign a priority. The following
code sets up some templates to use for the review.  The bugs have a
priority and fall under the &quot;Issues&quot; heading while the questions get
put under the &quot;Questions&quot; heading.
</p><p></p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">org-remember-insinuate</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">define-key</span> <span class="nv">global-map</span> <span class="s">&quot;\C-cr&quot;</span> <span class="ss">'org-remember</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-remember-templates</span>
      <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">&quot;Code Review High&quot;</span> <span class="nv">?h</span> <span class="s">&quot;* TODO [#A] %?\n  %i\n  %a&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;~/Review.org&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Issues&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Code Review Medium&quot;</span> <span class="nv">?m</span> <span class="s">&quot;* TODO [#B] %?\n  %i\n  %a&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;~/Review.org&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Issues&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Code Review Low&quot;</span> <span class="nv">?l</span> <span class="s">&quot;* TODO [#C] %?\n  %i\n  %a&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;~/Review.org&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Issues&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Code Review Question&quot;</span> <span class="nv">??</span> <span class="s">&quot;* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;~/Review.org&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;Questions&quot;</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that I used 
<verbatim>org-remember</verbatim> (instead of 
<verbatim>org-capture</verbatim>) because my
<!-- 
 -->coworkers are on emacs 23.2 so I had to be compatible wit the default
version of org-mode for that emacs version. 
</p><p>There is one additional sticking point to discuss for this
solution. The links produced are really a search string within the
file. That means that if there are two lines with the same content,
the link would find only the first occurrence of the line.  The main
concern is that a comment on a later line could link (accidentally) to
an earlier line.  There are two ways to look at this.  First, you may
feel that the issue is the same regardless of the line (if they are
the same lines), so linking to one over the other is a minor
detail. Or, you may feel that the exact line is the important item to
capture and, in that case, you would need a line number.
</p><p>There is a way to link using only line numbers.  Use the code shown
below to create the file search string from the line number.
</p><p></p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">my/linenum</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;Use line number as the file linking item&quot;</span>
<span class="c1">;; Optionally, predicate this technique to</span>
<span class="c1">;; only certain modes</span>
<span class="c1">;; e.g.</span>
<span class="c1">;; (when (eq major-mode 'cperl-mode) ...</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">number-to-string</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">org-current-line</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'org-create-file-search-functions</span>
          <span class="ss">'my/linenum</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As indicated by the comments, this linking stragety can also predicate
on the major mode used for finer control. 
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></section><section class="hsec2"><h2>Usage</h2><p>Once setup is complete, simply follow along in the source code.  When
an issue or question comes up, hit 
<verbatim>C-c r</verbatim> and select the proper
<!-- 
 -->template.  Fill in the details and complete the entry.  You will be
back in the source code buffer ready to consider the next issue.
</p><p>After the review, you can easily sort the issues by priority.  Go to
the header for the issues and hit 
<verbatim>C-c ^</verbatim>.  A prompt will ask you how
<!-- 
 -->to sort.  In this case, select priority and the list sorts correctly.
</p><p>The TODO items make it easy for the author to track the progress
against the review tasks.
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></section><section class="hsec2"><h2>Additional Considerations</h2><p>The templates themselves could provide more information about the
given issues in the review.
</p><p></p><p></p><section class="hsec3"><h3>Reviewer Name</h3><p>Adding a reviewer name to an item (as a property) will make it easy
for the code author to go back and clarify after a meeting. Tracking
ownership also lets the author know who should review the fix if
necessary.
</p><p>The sorting features in org-mode also provides the ability to sort on
properties, so lumping together reviewers' comments should not be
difficult.
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></section><section class="hsec3"><h3>Time</h3><p>If you use and capture times, even more sorting can reflect the order
of items raised in the meeting. This would help as you read through
the code again to see the issues in that order.
</p><p>Assigned deadlines also provide sorting methods. Items arranged by due
date could be another view of the task list.
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></section><section class="hsec3"><h3>Tags</h3><p>Certain features or bugs may align with a milestone. If this is
something to consider, then the capture templates could provide
tagging functionality. Later, the tags give a way to track sets of
tasks together and get a picture of the progress.
